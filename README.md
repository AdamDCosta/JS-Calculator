# JS-Calculator

This is a mobile-first calculator app written in vanilla Javascript and styled with SCSS. 

It was a project set during week 4 on the full-time  *_nology* course. The aims were to take what we had learnt up to that point to produce a working calculator, implementing a mobile-first approach and to practice writing psuedocode.

## Testing

A cypress test file has been added to check that the buttons and calculations work as they should for the end user.
